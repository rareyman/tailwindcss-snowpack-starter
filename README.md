# TailwindCSS Snowpack Starter

A simple TailwindCSS and Snowpack starter template. Helpful for designers wanting to have a fast and easy starting point for mocking up web pages with TailwindCSS.


To get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rareyman/tailwindcss-snowpack-starter.git

   cd tailwindcss-snowpack-starter
   ```

1a. Optional: Rename project folder and rename project name in `package.json`

1b. Optional Git: Remove Remote to disassociate project from the original starter project

   git remote remove origin
   ```

1c. Optional Git: Add Remote to your own Git Repository

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   # Using npm
